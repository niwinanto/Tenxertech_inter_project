# Enabling DMA in SPI controller
The CHIP Pro uses allwinner A10 based SOM called GR8. The SPI controller in this module supports DMA. Here a driver for the SPI controller is used with DMA enabled. The corresponding changes are made in the device tree files. The driver is compiled with [NextThingCo](https://github.com/NextThingCo/linux) linux fork (kernel 4.4.30). Replace the driver in drivers/spi/spi-sun4i.c
